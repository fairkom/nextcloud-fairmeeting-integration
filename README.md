# fairmeeting integration for Nextcloud

Integrate the **fairmeeting** video conferencing service seamlessly into your Nextcloud!  
**fairmeeting** is based on the Jitsi software, hosted by fairkom in the EU, thus fully **GDPR compliant**.

**[fairmeeting.net](https://fairmeeting.net)** is set as the default server. Unlike `meet.jit.si`, it requires no additional login/token and avoids the 5-minute limit on embedded conferences (which meet.jit.si introduced in 2023). Fair use conference duration is max one hour.
